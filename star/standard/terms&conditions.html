            depending on the developer's account registration information
            accumilated at the beginning then we tweak our care to match their taste
            of expirience

        <h3>Account heat levels</h3>
        <p id="gspot">
            Your heat level is your risk taking meter it will be used to waiver you
            been trustworthy or not
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            A heat level is a scale that measures your honesty and safe usage with
            our portal the lower the heat level the better
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            When you login into your account for the first time it's heat level is
            by default set to 4.9 reason behind that is that you havent earned our
            trust badge yet
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            Account heat levels amount to a maximum of 10 but each account recieves
            1 warning messages before increasing their account heat level before
            performing a risky task.
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            A heat level is not limited to the standard scaling up or down of
            numbers it can bounce from 0 to 10 in an instant depending on the
            critial case reported so use it wisely
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            An account with a heat level 5 and above are deemed as critical and thus
            could possibly face a loss of data, borrowed periphelas and or
            suspension or termination of services
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            A heat level can be decreased by depositing money into our trustfund
            which will be used to help other developers within the forum in their
            times of need.
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            Heat drops purchases between 0.5 - 1.5 will often charge at the price
            range of P50.00 to P100.00, Heat drops purchases more than 3 - 6 will
            often charge at the price range of P1,000.00 - P10,000.00
        </p>
        <br />
        <p id="gspot">
            Heat drop purchases higher than 3.9 will clear your heat down to 0 if
            your heat was below 3 if not will only decrease it
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            Not saying it is impossible to be at heat level 0 if your record on our
            servers show a bad history you may be suspended temporarily from using
            our service for 14 working days during that time your account will be
            strictly monitored by the developers or the relevant authority.

            funds will be returned to you within 30 days
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Account ban, freeze or termination</h3>
        <p id="gspot">
            Any sign of miscellaneous, weird, untrustworthy, criminal or illegal
            activies on our portal will lead to your account being closed either
            temporarily or permanently
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">

            account activity and will report bad usage if detected or you have been
            reported
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            The trained AI was trained to learn a user's engagement with various or
            a series of events that would help us better protect your account from
            criminals
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            You will lose access to your account in 30mins when it reaches account
            heat level 8.7
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            In an event that your account faces such a fate we may request for
            additional personal information to be used to verify, or match against
            your previous actions to help us know if you will be allowed back into
            our portal or not.
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            But that occuring doesnt guarantee that we will reduce your heat level.
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            Time is a healing factor so dont worry if your heat level doesnt drop
            after a few days or months it will go down but it will only go down to
            as low as your account activity
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            Inactive accounts in most cases could have close to a range of 0 - 0.5
            heat levels and will be frozen until the user returns.
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            Active accounts with 0 heat levels will be represented by an online
            status/ badge of trust
        </p>
        <br />
        <p id="gspot">
            Trust badges are earned and cannot be bought, You can earn a trust badge
            if your account reaches a heat level of 1.5 and is active, it may sound
            easy to earn it but easy as it comes easy as it goes
        </p>
        <p id="gspot">
            Meaning to say you will lose your trust badge when you reach heat level
            5.1
        </p>
        <br />
