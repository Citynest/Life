      <h1 class="gspot">I welcome you with open arms</h1>
      <p class="gspot">My name is Kevin that's all you need to know, the fact that you came across this page is because you cared</p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I literally took close to an hour perfecting this page just for you to
        see it
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I wanted to impress you with my knowldge and skills. It may be common
        knowledge to you to see a website
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">But I would like you to keep in mind that coding isnt for everybody</p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I actually enjoy it because it involves problem solving. I am not good
        in math honestly but I have my way with figures.
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        The point of this letter to you is that I am interested in joining
        your IT development team
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I belive to carry with me external insight that could benefit the both
        of us
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I am being open with you and I hope to recieve the same energy from you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="gspot">
        I may not know you but I am willing to know you with the chance that you
        can help me and I you.
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        But dear partner I am in a crisis of some serious financial strain allow
        me to work for you for some incentive on a contract based agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I do not ask for much my problems may not be as big as yours but I
        certainly want to earn enough to get by on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I do not want to live based on survival alone I want to live as
        comfortable as possible too.
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I promise to use my knowledge and skills to your benefit as you see fit
        and to connect/ support with my soon to be colleages in exchange for a
        seasonal payment of least $9970.99 (P113,435.47)
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I got bills to pay and mouths to feed, a dream to archieve and that
        amount may be a good starting point for me. All I would like to see
        through is making sure every motswana doesnt suffer from internet data
        charges help me do that.
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I hope to hear from you soon with the intent of being called for an
        interview.
      </p>
      <p class="gspot">
        I encourage you to keep an open mind, I am but just a simple honest man
      </p>
    <br />
    <br />
