        <h3>What Is The Universal Church? Who We Are, and How We Define The Universal Church</h3><br>
        <p>The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God was established over four decades ago as an expression of faith in the living God. As a Bible-based church, its goals are to reveal the power of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in transforming and saving lives.

            After the creation of the universe, God the Father was the member of the Trinity to first manifest to mankind, speaking and teaching them how to follow and obey His principles. These teachings were given to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and so many other heroes of faith who followed and obeyed His voice.
            
            Yet despite centuries of God’s attentive love and mercy and establishing a covenant with His people, mankind allowed their sin to corrupt them and turn them away from God. Most strayed from righteousness and obedience to God and followed the urges of their own heart. But God, in His infinite grace and love for humanity, sent His Only Son as the fulfillment of His Holy Law and Commandments, to be a sacrifice for our sins.</p>
        <br><h3>God’s Solution for a Sinful World</h3><br>
        <p>The Lord Jesus Christ, God’s Son, revealed Himself to mankind in human form when He was born into the world. He suffered, was crucified, died and was buried, but on the third day He rose again. He guaranteed salvation for mankind and freedom from all of the oppression of the evil one, for any and all who repent and choose to believe.

            After the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and His return to heaven, God the Holy Spirit manifest His presence among mankind, beginning from the day of Pentecost and continuing on until today. He reveals Himself within the hearts of believers who surrender their lives completely to Him as they put their faith in the risen Savior, Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit convicts us of sins through of our conscience, revealing our sinful state so that we can truly repent, receive God’s forgiveness and be welcomed into His Kingdom.
            
            The Holy Trinity acts in unity, power and wisdom from eternity to eternity, and reveals His will to us today through the Bible, which is divinely inspired as stated in 1 Timothy 3:16-17, “All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for rebuking, for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be perfect and perfectly equipped for every good work.”
            
            Whoever places his life in God’s hands can only perform His good works once he first repents of his sins. This inner transformation is publicly expressed through water baptism by immersion. The sinful human nature is buried, and a new person is born as he is raised up from his watery grave, ready to do God’s will on earth.</p></div></center><br>
