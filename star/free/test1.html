            <h1>About ConnectBots</h1>
            <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong>
            
            ConnectBots is an innovative platform aimed at revolutionizing the delivery, payment, and transportation systems in Botswana. We are building an all-in-one web application that connects users with local stores, offers a unified payment system, facilitates e-commerce for local products like beef and diamonds, manages transportation routes, and provides job opportunities for vehicle owners. Our mission is to enhance convenience, efficiency, and economic opportunities for the people of Botswana.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Developer Account Fee:</strong>
            
            To ensure the security and commitment of developers contributing to the ConnectBots platform, we require a one-time developer account fee of P500 via Orange Money. This fee will grant you access to a ConnectBots developer account, allowing you to contribute to the project and earn compensation for commendable efforts. 
            Please note that this fee is non-refundable.<br><br>
            
            Please submit the P500 developer account fee via Orange Money to [+26772293757].
            
            Once you have made the payment, please click the <strong>NEXT</strong> button to continue with your developer account registration.<br><br>
            
            
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Note: The developer account fee is required to ensure the commitment and security of developers on the platform. It helps us maintain a dedicated and trustworthy community of developers who are invested in the success of ConnectBots.</strong><br>
