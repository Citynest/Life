        A system that allows us to regulate service charges with the middle man
        UN-INVOLVED to keep product costs & services low and this would be our
        main way of processing transactions
      </p>
      <p>
        but wait üõë, the world has so many economic problems in fairness
        controlled currencies is to blame.

        To upgrade your room services or buy anything on the portal you will use
        bitcoin, but transactions between you and other third parties will
        result in your money being converted into bitcoin so that it can move
        easily around the world at low service fees or even for free (thanks to
        the bitcoin network) then release your money on the other side as fiat
        (from our servers) to allow your payment reciever to simply cash out at
        any nearby ATM within a few simple clicks on the portal
      </p>
      <p>
        Service fees are either low or high depending on the type of transaction
        you are executing and the amount you want to move from one end of each
        financial institution that sits between you and your client to receive
        their payment
