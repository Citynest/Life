This is a WEB3 inspired website as I would like to believe it is the foundation of Web3 before VR and AR, it currently has no primary goal than do the obvious Web3 tactics which are still in development to allow users accomplish basic needs of life like

-Shopping -Socializing -entertainment -work related portals/ services

all tuned to each user's preferences

So the website's layout will be unique to each user as development continues.

This website is highly optimized for Desktop viewing/ landscape mode on computers, tablets and large mobile devices although it is usable in portrait mode some attributes will not show quiet well or at all.

============================= 18/05/2022 Today's update is delayed on your end (the user) since the last update 2 months ago I have been very busy

I had to push this update even though it isnt useful to you now because I am going solo in all this

I enjoy it though... this update is rushed because I didnt want to stash anything away it was important.... I am lowkey using the services I should be giving you via the website for my personal gain who is to argue I run this show anyway haha but enjoy your yourself

i'll keep updating you until i get it right, if you want to help just make a pull request & let's build this website together!

============================= 02/07/22 I finally managed to get auth working in that single html page with a single form element

After getting it right I noticed I have t been giving the other pages some love so everything after login is a mess, but fixing them shouldnt be as difficult as setting up auth 2.0

============================= 06/07/22 I keep making errors when deploying updates forgetting to switch between development mode and production mode which brings my website entirly down soon after authentication(for now that's okay but it aint good for convinience)

Reason being I am trying to keep things organised such as

Traffic
Content
Products
Purchases etc
it is a lot to do but it'll get there

============================= 28/07/2022 Today I made another breakthrough (I think) now my website can show stored data from the database but the intention was to use the database alongside with the Nav bar particularly after loggin in to display the current user's name on the Nav header (currently my primary focus so still in development)

This way I would be able to allow the website to automatically manage my users with little to no maintainance from my end (the developer) so I will end here for tonight... I am going to watch some animeðŸ’–ðŸ”¥ See yall on the next update (tomorrow or a later time)

============================= 09/08/2022
Changed the website to a dynamic one using the php language and but github pages doesnt
support PHP pages so I had to switch it back to static if I wanted to keep using gh-pg

No worries though JavaScript is here to help, my website isnt entirely static, it is static "enough" to carry out
necessary actions online. Most of the website has a Nav bar (which I call the "Portal") which isnt static but dynamic and most of my webpages have this Nav bar
Todays update brings you

- Ability to Logout anywhere on the website
- SHA256 encryption (we dont store passwords we kept our end of the promise of allowing you (the user) to handle your own privacy)
- Squashed some minor bugs

The next stage of development is building the Shop
See you again next time folks
